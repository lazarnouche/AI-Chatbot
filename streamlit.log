2024-02-24 13:18:12,932 - INFO - The returned answer is:  The SSC-A (Single Stream Controller for Additive Injection) is a component of the Fusion4 system that is designed to control one single additive stream. It is used in product transfer applications where multiple products need to be accurately combined, such as road tanker loading, rail off-loading, or pipeline transfer. The SSC-A monitors the flow of the wild stream and uses this flow rate to accurately pace the flow of the additive stream to a pre-determined target ratio in parts per million (ppm). It operates through rapid and accurate injections of small volumes of additive at evenly spaced intervals.
